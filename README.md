## Accordion Structure
## Workgroup Charters
Each workgroup defines and maintains a charter, a living document that describes the group's responsibilities, meetings, and how the group interacts with other workgroups. Each charter must answer the following questions, although a workgroup may include additional information:
- What is this group’s mission?*
- What are this group’s responsibilities?*
- How can people contact this group? (Slack channel, Slack user group, email address, etc)
- How often does this group meet?
- When and where does this group meet? (include a virtual meeting link if possible)
- How are this group’s meetings run?
- Are there any requirements for joining? (optional)
- Other than attending meetings, what is expected of members of this group?
- What tool does this group use to track its tasks?
- What metrics can be used to measure this group’s success?
- What can other groups request from this group? (describe each process)*
- What decision-making process does this group use? (if using a process other than the WAYO default)*
### Making changes to a charter
Charters can and should be updated as needed, but a standard process should be followed. Workgroups should discuss revisions together and make an announcement to the other workgroups when a new version of the charter is released.
Some charter changes will require approval from the Steering Committee before the new version can be released. These are the four questions marked with asterisks above, as they concern the specific role and responsibilities of the workgroup and how it fits in with the rest of WAYO. Any change to the answers for these questions should be submitted as a draft proposal to the Steering Committee for approval. Additionally, the Steering Committe must approve the initial version of any workgroup's charter prior to its first publication.
### A workgroup's initial charter
When a workgroup is initially formed and has not been fully staffed, a basic version of the charter should be drafted. This charter should answer these basic questions only, so that the charter can be used to recruit sufficient crew:
- How can people contact this group? (Slack channel, Slack user group, etc)
- How often does this group meet?
- What is this group’s mission?
- What are this group’s responsibilities?
- Are there any requirements for joining? (optional)
Once the recuitment period is over and an appropriate number of crew have joined the workgroup, the workgroup should prioritize the drafting of a complete charter.
