## Introduction

This handbook is maintained by the WAYO Steering Committee and is intended to be a [Living Document](#living-document). This means that WAYO crew are welcome to propose edits, revisions, or updates to these guidelines when the need arises. For more information, see the [Living Document](#living-document) entry in the [Glossary](#glossary), and the [Updating Living Documents](#updating-living-documents) entry in the [Procedures](#procedures) section.

## Station Mission Statement

WAYO provides a broadcast platform for Greater Rochester residents to express their passions, ideas, and artistry, and to foster diverse programming, creative freedom, social engagement, and community collaboration.

## Glossary

### Living Document

Important WAYO documentation is maintained as **Living Documents**. A Living Document is always evolving; each document can be updated when needed and the station operates based upon the contents of each document's latest version. 

WAYO's Living Documents are stored in the [wayofm organization](https://github.com/wayofm/) on GitHub, which has built-in features to track the change history of each document and to allow change proposals to be reviewed and approved. See the "Updating Living Documents" entry in the [Procedures](#procedures) section for more information. 

#### Versioning 

Each document has a three-part version number like `1.10.2`, following the concept of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- A small correction (fixing spelling, improving clarity) is considered a **patch** version update and results in the third number increasing (i.e. `1.10.2` -> `1.10.3`)
- A change to a policy or procedure, or any change that would modify WAYO's operations, is considered a **minor** version update and results in the second number increasing (i.e. `1.10.2` -> `1.11.0`)
- A change that amounts to a complete overhaul of a given document is considered a **major** version update and results in the first number increasing (i.e. `1.10.2` -> `2.0.0`)

A document's version number should be listed near the top of the document along with the version's date of publication.

### Station Roles

**CREW**: Crew serve on workgroups to directly support the operation and direction of WAYO

**PROGRAMMERS**: Programmers host shows, and are encouraged to serve as **crew** or as **volunteers** (and vice versa)

**VOLUNTEERS**: Volunteers help with general station tasks as identified by workgroups and are not considered **crew**. As with **crew**, **volunteers** can (and are encouraged to!) be **programmers** as well

## Workgroups 

### Overview

A **workgroup** is a small group of **crew** working towards the same goal, with occasional help from **volunteers**.

- Each workgroup operates according to guidelines defined in their group's charter
- Workgroups have regularly scheduled meetings
- Workgroup members hold each other accountable and train each other on common tasks
- Workgroups interface with each other to accomplish tasks that involve more than one area of expertise
- An individual can serve in more than one workgroup at a time, but it is recommended that they do not serve in more than **3** at once

### Accordion Structure

The Accordion Structure is a strategy that can be used to accommodate periods of decreased crew staffing. It allows workgroups to combine and then divide again as needed to ensure sufficient representation and accountability across each domain and ultimately, to accomplish the important work of the individual workgroups and reduce burnout.

#### When to enact the Accordion Structure:

- When 1 or more workgroups within a single domain has only 1 crew member or has two crew members and wishes to enact the Accordion Structure
  - This workgroup can be considered **depleted** and the Accordion Structure should be enacted for that domain

**NOTE:** The Guidance domain is a special case which cannot enact the Accordion Structure. In the case of a short-staffed **Money** workgroup, the Steering Committee may provide support for the Money group or assume its responsibilities entirely. See the Steering Committee section below for more information.  

#### How to enact the Accordion Structure:

- When a workgroup becomes depleted, the depleted workgroup must notify the Steering Committee that there is a need to enact the Accordion Structure. If there are no crew members left in the depleted workgroup, a remaining group in the domain must handle this notification process if the Steering Committee is not already aware. 
- The Steering Committee will then facilitate the combination of the workgroups in that domain to form one larger workgroup, named after the domain. The Operations workgroup will support any logistical needs of the workgroup combination, e.g., Slack updates.
- If it does not already exist, the domain workgroup must draft a new charter to reflect the combined interests, goals, and responsibilities of all domain sub-groups. The Steering Committee should oversee this process and approve the drafted charter to ensure it is comprehensive.
- This new workgroup will operate in “skeleton crew” mode until the time it can divide into sub-groups again. That is, the workgroup will focus primarily on the tasks considered essential to each of the sub-groups.
- In order to maximize group cohesion, the combined group’s crew members should no longer consider themselves members of the prior sub-group that they served on, but rather simply a part of the larger domain workgroup. 
- Simultaneously, both the combined group and the People & Placement workgroups will work to recruit new members to the combined workgroup in order to replenish the depleted workgroup.

#### How to Reverse the Accordion Structure:

- When the Accordion Structure is enacted for a domain, the goal should be to ultimately expand again to reinstate unique workgroups for each sub-domain. To that end, the Steering Committee should periodically “take the temperature” of the workgroup in skeleton crew mode to see if members are ready to expand again to full capacity. This check-in should occur at least monthly.
  - It may take some time for the depleted workgroup to be ready to reverse the Accordion Structure. The combined workgroup should consider factors including (but not limited to) the number of members in the combined workgroup who would join each sub-group, the comfort level of group members with expanding again, any onboarding or orientation time needed to get new members up to speed, etc.
- When a workgroup in skeleton crew mode feels ready to reverse the Accordion Structure, the workgroup must approve the reversal based on the decision making process outlined in its charter.
- Once the workgroup has agreed to expand again, the Steering Committee must then approve the decision to divide the workgroup based on the best interests of the station.

### Workgroup Charters

Each workgroup defines and maintains a **charter**: a living document that describes the group's responsibilities, meetings, and how the group interacts with other workgroups. Each charter must answer the following questions, although a workgroup may include additional information:
- What is this group’s mission?*
- What are this group’s responsibilities?*
- How can people contact this group? (Slack channel, Slack user group, email address, etc)
- How often does this group meet?
- When and where does this group meet? (include a virtual meeting link if possible)
- How are this group’s meetings run?
- Are there any requirements for joining? (optional)
- Other than attending meetings, what is expected of members of this group?
- What tool does this group use to track its tasks?
- What metrics can be used to measure this group’s success?
- What can other groups request from this group? (describe each process)*
- What decision-making process does this group use? (if using a process other than the WAYO default)*

#### Making changes to a charter

Charters can and should be updated as needed, but a standard process should be followed. Workgroups should discuss revisions together and make an announcement to the other workgroups when a new version of the charter is released.
Some charter changes will require approval from the Steering Committee before the new version can be released. These are the four questions marked with asterisks above, as they concern the specific role and responsibilities of the workgroup and how it fits in with the rest of WAYO. Any change to the answers for these questions should be submitted as a draft proposal to the Steering Committee for approval. Additionally, the Steering Committe must approve the initial version of any workgroup's charter prior to its first publication.

#### A workgroup's initial charter

When a workgroup is initially formed and has not been fully staffed, a basic version of the charter should be drafted. This charter should answer these basic questions only, so that the charter can be used to recruit sufficient crew:
- How can people contact this group? (Slack channel, Slack user group, etc)
- How often does this group meet?
- What is this group’s mission?
- What are this group’s responsibilities?
- Are there any requirements for joining? (optional)

Once the recuitment period is over and an appropriate number of crew have joined the workgroup, the workgroup should prioritize the drafting of a complete charter.

### Steering Committee

The **Steering Committee** workgroup has certain unique attributes compared to other workgroups:

- Steering Committee membership is limited to a maximum of 7 people at any given time, and a minimum of 5 people in "skeleton crew" mode.
- Members of the Steering Committee commit to serving 2 year terms, after which they must resign from the Steering Committee.
  - Past Steering Committee members become eligible to serve again 2 years after their most recent term has ended.
  - Past Steering Committee members may serve on other WAYO workgroups. 
- Terms are staggered, such that approximately half of the Committee changes over each year.
  - Example: 3 members start a 2-year term in 2021, then 4 members start a 2-year term in 2022.
- To be eligible to serve on the Steering Committee, a person must have been a WAYO **programmer** or **crew** member (on another workgroup) for at least 1 year.
  - Exceptions to this rule can be made in the name of diversity.
- WAYO station leadership as of March 2021 will collaborate to define the process for recruiting initial Steering Committee members. The process must meet these requirements: 
  - The process must be defined in writing and published in the WAYO GitHub organization.
  - An eligible person who wishes to serve on the Steering Committee must submit an application.
  - A body of at least 3 people (and not comprised solely of WAYO station leadership) must be formed to review applications and interview applicants. Starting in 2022, these reviews and interviews will be handled by the current Steering Committee along with the People & Placement workgroup (or Day to Day domain workgroup, if People & Placement is depleted).
  - After an interview, each interviewer will privately evaluate the applicant, awarding points in a variety of qualitative categories. For example: award 1-5 points for the applicant's communication skills, award 1-5 points for relevant experience. 
  - Each applicant will also be automatically awarded points in a variety of factual categories. For example: award 1 point for each year the applicant has volunteered for WAYO, award 10 points if the applicant's identity does not currently have representation on the Steering Committee.
  - The applicant's final "score" will be calculated by summing the average rating of each qualitative category along with the points from the factual categories. The applicants with the highest point values will become the nominees. For example, if there are 4 open positions on the Steering Committee, the 4 applicants with the highest point totals will become nominated. 
  - Finally, the nominees will be presented to the WAYO programmer body for approval by majority vote. If a nominee is rejected by the programmer body, the applicant with the next highest point total becomes nominated and the process repeats. Approved nominees become members of the Steering Committee.
  - For the initial 2021 Steering Committee recruitment, 3 of the approved nominees, selected at random, will serve a 1-year term instead of 2 years.   
- In any given year, when new Steering Committee members have been selected, there will be an overlap period of approximately one month where all current, incoming, and outgoing members collaborate to onboard the new members and align their efforts to ensure a consistency of vision.         

## Policies

This section of the handbook is intended to store station-wide policies as set out by the future Steering Committee, such as a Sexual Harrassment policy and a Diversity/Inclusion policy.

## Procedures

### Updating Living Documents

The procedure outlined here leverages built-in GitHub functionality to allow WAYO crew to propose changes to a [Living Document](#living-document), and for those changes to be reviewed and eventually approved or rejected by the appropriate workgroup or workgroup(s). GitHub uses the concept of "branches" to allow multiple concurrent versions of the same file repository to be stored, which allows the published version of a document to be stored as the "master" or main branch, and a draft of the next version to be stored as an "editing" branch. Then, when the draft is ready to be published, the "editing" branch is "merged" into the main branch and becomes the new published version. 

**Note**: When a new Living Document repository is created in GitHub, a [branch protection rule](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) should be configured so that changes cannot be made to the master branch directly. When configuring the rule, enter "master" as the **branch name pattern**, check the box for **Require pull request reviews before merging**, set **Required approving reviews** to 2 or more, check the box for **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**, and check the box for **Include administrators**. Finally, click **Create**.

Now, crew can propose changes to a document by following these steps:

1. In the GitHub repository for the document, [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch). Give the new branch a name that briefly describes the nature of the proposed change. For example, "add-conflict-resolution-policy". As the example suggests, capital letters and spaces should be avoided.
2. After creating a branch, GitHub will generally automatically select the new branch as what you're currently viewing. You can verify this by looking at the branch dropdown selector in the upper left of the interface. If your branch is not selected, use the dropdown to select it. 
3. With the new branch selected, click the filename of the document that you wish to edit (i.e. `README.md`). Then, in the upper right of the interface, click the pencil icon to begin editing.
4. WAYO recommends using Markdown Language for document formatting and styling. A [quick reference for Markdown Language is available here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). While editing a document, you can freely switch between the **Edit file** and **Preview changes** tabs to see what your applied formatting will look like.
5. When edits are complete, fill out the **Commit changes** form below the editing interface. Use the default title ("Update README.md" or similar), leave the description field blank, and verify that you're making the commit to the correct branch (the selected option should say **Commit directly to the {name} branch**, where **{name}** is the branch name you chose in step 1). Finally, click **Commit changes**. 
6. Click the **Pull requests** tab at the top of the repository (**below** the repository name, not the one at the very top of the page). After clicking the tab, you should see a message like "{branch name} had recent pushes 1 minute ago". Click the **Compare & pull request** button to the right of this message.
7. Fill out the **Open a pull request** form. Give your pull request a **title** briefly describing your proposal (i.e. "Add a conflict resolution policy") and in the **Leave a comment** field, give any necessary additional details or context regarding why you are proposing this change. This could include background history around a particular issue, or prior decisions that have led to this proposed change. Finally, click **Create pull request**.
8. Now that the Pull Request is open, relevant workgroups can review the proposed changes. This is done by clicking the **Files changed** tab of the pull request and then clicking the **Review changes** button on the far right. Reviewers can either add comments, request changes, or immediately approve the pull request. 
9. When enough reviewers have added their approvals, the pull request is able to be merged. The merge should be performed by the workgroup that maintains the document in question. Before merging, the workgroup should verify that the document's version number has been increased appropriately, [following these guidelines](#versioning). Then, the merge can be done by clicking the **Merge pull request** button at the bottom of the pull request form (on the **Conversation** tab).
10. The new version of the document has now been published, and should be announced to the rest of the station using an agreed-upon method.
